<main>

This component represents the game controls. It is responsible for the game's
start, pause, and reset.

It is also the location where document-level keyboard events are handled.

There are also controls here that work on mobile, in the form of buttons.

## Example

```html
<game-controls></game-controls>
```

```{=html}
<game-controls></game-controls>
```
