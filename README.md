This is a little game framework for making Zelda-style, top-down 2d adventure games. 

It is built mostly with [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

## Design Goals

I have always wanted to make a language creation game, where you go around trying to — well, different README, because this game framework is only a step in that direction. I need to learn to make a game in this genre. I have tried various times and failed. Hope springs eternal. Let’s go.

My design goals include:

- Make a game that is fun to play.
- Make it possible to easily customize the game.
- Make it possible to easily create new games.
- Learn as much as possible about game development in the process.

Here is the first horrible prototype I built:

As you can see, this game enables:

* Moving around a grid.
* Collision detection.
* Automatically generated islands.
* Randomly placed enemies.
* Randomly placed items.
* A player character.
* Enemy characters.
* Items.
* A game board.
* A game UI.

That’s about it so far. 

As they say, throw the first one away. (I will probably throw this README away too.)
